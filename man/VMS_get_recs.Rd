\arguments{
\item{fn.oracle.username}{default is \code{'_none_'} This is your username for
accessing oracle objects. If you have a value for \code{oracle.username} 
stored in your environment (e.g. from an rprofile file), this can be left out
and that value will be used.  If a value for this is provided, it will take 
priority over your existing value.}

\item{fn.oracle.password}{default is \code{'_none_'} This is your password for
accessing oracle objects. If you have a value for \code{oracle.password}  
stored in your environment (e.g. from an rprofile file), this can be left out
and that value will be used.  If a value for this is provided, it will take 
priority over your existing value.}

\item{fn.oracle.dsn}{default is \code{'_none_'} This is your dsn/ODBC
identifier for accessing oracle objects. If you have a value for 
\code{oracle.dsn} stored in your environment (e.g. from an rprofile file), 
this can be left and that value will be used.  If a value for this is 
provided, it will take priority over your existing value.}

\item{usepkg}{default is \code{'rodbc'}. This indicates whether the 
connection to Oracle should use \code{'rodbc'} or \code{'roracle'} to 
connect.  rodbc is slightly easier to setup, but roracle will extract data 
~ 5x faster.}

\item{dateStart}{default is \code{NULL}. This is the start date ('YYYY-MM-DD') 
for your VMS data search}

\item{dateEnd}{default is \code{NULL}. This is the end date ('YYYY-MM-DD') 
for your VMS data search. If this is left NULL, one year of data will be
returned}

\item{vrnList}{default is \code{NULL}.  A vector or VRNs can be added so 
that the only positions returned match particular vessel(s).}

\item{hrBuffer}{default is \code{4}.  This is the number of hours worth of 
VMS data you would like to pad your area search by.  For example, if a vessel
has a single VMS position in the results, padding it will add additional 
points before and after the intrusion which can illustrate what it was doing 
at the time.}

\item{minLon}{default is \code{NULL}. This can be used to set a minimum Longitude}

\item{maxLon}{default is \code{NULL}. This can be used to set a maximum Longitude}

\item{minLat}{default is \code{NULL}. This can be used to set a minimum Latitude}

\item{maxLat}{default is \code{NULL}. This can be used to set a maximum Latitude}

\item{rowNum}{default is \code{50000}.  This is the maximum number of VMS 
records that can be extracted. It is in place to prevent crashing your 
application.}

\item{quietly}{default is \code{FALSE}.  This indicates whether or not
information about the process should be shown.}

\description{
This function extracts VMS data for a given timespan and area.  
A time buffer can be added returns other points that are not within the area
of interest, but give context to the path.
